"1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or 
more password(s)' (Automated)", Level 1 L1 - Corporate Enterprise Environment general use ,"This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have 
to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The 
value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value 
for standalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a 
domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the 
Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their 
password.  
The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).  
Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings 
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be 
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings 
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the 
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default 
password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or 
groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are 
completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active 
Directory Administrative Center.  
Note #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum 
limit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password 
history (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs.","The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker 
can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that 
may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is 
left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not 
prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the 
effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.  
If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same 
small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum 
password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can 
reuse their original password.  
Impact:  
The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password 
every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change 
their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write","Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
